        <h2>Hello Everyone!</h2>
        <p>My name is Sean Allen, and I am delighted to welcome you to my student profile page. I am currently pursuing a Computer Science, B.S. at Cal Poly Humboldt, and I am passionate about software engineering.</p>

        <h2>A little bit about me:</h2>
        <p>I hail from Arcata, CA and have always been enthusiastic about programming. When I'm not immersed in my studies, you can often find me spending time with family, working in the shop or golfing. I believe in the power of hard work and dedication, and I am excited about contributing to the local software development community.</p>

        <h2>Academic Journey:</h2>
        <p>I am dedicated to my academic pursuits and am particularly interested in software engineering and geospatial programming. I enjoy software engineering because of the many challenges each unique project presents. Through my coursework, I aim to expand my knowledge and become more proficient at my craft.</p>

        <h2>Extracurricular Activities:</h2>    
        <p>Beyond the classroom, I am actively involved in professional development and engineering work. These experiences have not only allowed me to develop valuable skills but have also provided opportunities to connect with my peers who share similar interests.</p>

        <h2>Future Aspirations:</h2>        
        <p>Looking ahead, I aspire to apply my love of development to an industry that I am equally passionate about. Whether it's geospatial sciences, sports, or education, I am excited about the possibilities that the future holds.</p>

        <h2>Connect with Me:</h2>        
        <p>I am always open to connecting with fellow students, professors, and anyone who shares common interests. Feel free to reach out, whether it's about academic collaboration, shared hobbies, or just a friendly chat. Let's make the most of our time at Cal Poly Humboldt together!</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to getting to know you better.</p>
